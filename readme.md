# House Price Prediction

In this project, I'm going to make perdiction of house price by some features. Dataset contains lots of feature, I use some feature selection methods like ANOVA, CHI2, Pearson correlation and other tools to select best features. Also in modeling, I used RandomForest, Adaboost, Linear Regression.
